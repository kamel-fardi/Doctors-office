# Doctors-office
We propose to model the management of patients in a doctor's office. A patient is characterized by: the last name, first name and an appointment field (for appointment) of integer type indicating whether the patient has an appointment or not: 0 if the patient is without appointment, 1 if the patient is with an appointment. Before being seen by the doctor, the patients entered a waiting room which will be modeled by a linked list of patients. A secretary brings in the patients with an appointment = 1 according to their order of arrival, then she brings in the others patients (those whose appointment = 0) according to their order of arrival as well.
